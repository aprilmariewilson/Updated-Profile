                Hi! I'm April, a full stack web developer with 20+ experience of customer service, corporate training and project management.
                I have an eye for design and a great feel for the needs of the client. I am a self-starter that loves to
                elevate and motivate teams. I have hired, trained and coached for many companies to create and maintain a
                culture that demands collaboration and accountability.
            </p>
            <p> I just completed a bootcamp through University of Utah focusing on HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js,
                multipile databases as well as React.js. These languages were not the only languages taught and you can see
                my complete list of technologies throughout my github account as well as throughout my application. I have
                such a passion for web development that I have continued and expanded my learning through trial and error,
                Google and by taking Udemy courses. I am strengthening my skills and problem solving everyday. I love the
                problem solving and creativity this field provides and I am very excited for this next chapter in my life.
                </p>


            <p> I am interested for working with a great company that inspires creacivity and challenging projects. I am looking for a diverse work environment with
                opportunity for growth and development. I entigrate into a variety of cultures with ease and have a team mentality. 
            </p>
